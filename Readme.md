Node's events module in the browser.

This is a wrapper around [component/emitter](https://github.com/component/emitter) that is api-compatible with node's events module.

[Events Node.js v0.8.11 Manual & Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html)

## Installation

Install with [component(1)](https://github.com/component/component)

```bash
$ npm install juliangruber/events
```

or

```bash
$ npm install events-component
```

## Usage example

```javascript
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter;
// or: var EventEmitter = require('events');

var ee = new EventEmitter();

ee.on('foo', function(data) {
  console.log('foo received', data);
})

ee.emit('foo', 'bar');
// -> 'foo received bar'
```
